This release break ABI. Recompiling your code should be enough.

- The new pkgconfig package name is libopenraw-0.2.

- libopenraw now requires Rust to build.

It adds or change the following API:

- NEW or_rawfile_get_vendorid(): Use this to get the vendor ID for the
  RAW file. While this is the same as the vendor part of the type ID
  that you'd obtain with the macro OR_GET_FILE_TYPEID_VENDOR(), it is
  obtained differently, and might be much slower. `ordiag` will check
  the consistency. The testsuite will fail if inconsistent.

- Some camera IDs have been changed. Name and value.

- or_rawdata_get_rendered_image() will not downscale to RGB8. Check
  the format returned.

It adds support for a certain number of cameras:

(list in the NEWS file)

- libopenraw now support parsing Canon new CR3 files.

- libopenraw now support parsing GoPro GPR files.

or_raw_file_new() will now detect content if it can't guess the type
from the extension.
