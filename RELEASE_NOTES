What's (visibly) new in 0.3.0
=============================

For more details see the NEWS file.

- Now requires a C++14 capable compiler to build.
- Largely improved metadata extraction on various format.
- More thumbnails are available on Panasonic RAW.
- Fix MakerNote on Pentax and Panasonic.
- 24 new cameras listed.

API changes:

- ORCfaPatternRef has been renamed to ORMosaicInfoRef.
  In consequence, or_cfapattern_*() is renamed to or_mosaicinfo_*().
  or_rawdata_get_mosaicinfo() replaces or_rawdata_get_cfa_pattern().
- NEW or_ifd_release() to release ORIfdDirRef.
- NEW or_ifd_get_name() and or_ifd_get_type() to get the name if an
  entry in the IFD and the type if the IFD repectively
- or_rawfile_get_ifd() support more types
- NEW or_ifd_dir_type is the new type IFD types and enum values have
  been rename.
- NEW or_iterator_*() to iterate through the metadata tags.
  NEW or_metavalue_get_count() to get the count in the metadata.

New tool:

- `exifdump` allow dumping EXIF from RAW files to assist development.

- Added a few more cameras.
- Fixed previews for CR3.

What's (visibly) new in 0.2.2

This release break ABI. Recompiling your code should be enough.

- The new pkgconfig package name is libopenraw-0.2.

- libopenraw now requires Rust to build.

It adds or change the following API:

- NEW or_rawfile_get_vendorid(): Use this to get the vendor ID for the
  RAW file. While this is the same as the vendor part of the type ID
  that you'd obtain with the macro OR_GET_FILE_TYPEID_VENDOR(), it is
  obtained differently, and might be much slower. `ordiag` will check
  the consistency. The testsuite will fail if inconsistent.

- Some camera IDs have been changed. Name and value.

- or_rawdata_get_rendered_image() will not downscale to RGB8. Check
  the format returned.

It adds support for a certain number of cameras:

(list in the NEWS file)

- libopenraw now support parsing Canon new CR3 files.

- libopenraw now support parsing GoPro GPR files.

or_raw_file_new() will now detect content if it can't guess the type
from the extension.
