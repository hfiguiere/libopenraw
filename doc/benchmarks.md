How to run the benchmarks
=========================

Note: these benchmark I used to quantify improvements or regression in
the code.

## Preparation

Samples come from [Pixl.us RAW repository](https://raw.pixls.us/)

You can rsync the whole repository into `raw-pixls-us-data`.

## Running

`RAWFILES_ROOT` environment need to be set to the `raw-pixls-us-data` directory.
